Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud.

SES is a fully managed email platform that supports transactional messages, notifications, and marketing campaigns. You will verify your email identity or domain, configure basic settings, and understand how SES processes and delivers messages.\nWhy using Amazon SES Amazon SES is commonly used in cloud-based applications due to its reliability, cost efficiency, and ease of integration.\nHigh deliverability: SES uses trusted Amazon mail servers and supports SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to reduce spam filtering. Flexible integration: Send emails via SES API, AWS SDK, SMTP interface, or Lambda. Scalable and cost-effective: Suitable for workloads from small to large scale, costing only $0.10 per 1,000 emails. Built-in monitoring: Track bounces, complaints, and deliveries using SNS and CloudWatch. Secure and controlled: Manage permissions with IAM policies and restrict allowed sending identities. SES Architecture Amazon SES architecture is built around three core components that define how emails are authenticated, transmitted, and monitored.\n1. Verified Identities Before sending messages, SES requires verification of your sending domain or email address.\nThis prevents unauthorized use and ensures SES can send emails on your behalf.\nVerification usually requires DNS records:\nSPF (TXT) — verifies the sender DKIM (CNAME) — provides cryptographic signing DMARC (TXT, optional) — adds domain-level protection 2. Email Sending Workflow Once verification is complete, your application can send messages using the SES API, AWS SDKs, or SMTP.\nHigh-level workflow: SES automatically handles email routing, retries, throttling, and formatting.\n3.
