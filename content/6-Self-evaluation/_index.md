- Had to recreate some technical details from memory
- Documentation sometimes less detailed than if written in real-time
- Added extra effort at end of week to catch up on documentation

**Improvement Plan:**

- **Real-Time Documentation**: Write documentation concurrently with implementation
- **Decision Log**: Maintain log of architectural decisions as they are made
- **Code Comments**: Write detailed comments while coding, not afterward
- **Weekly Documentation Time**: Schedule dedicated time for documentation review and updates
- **Templates**: Use structured templates to make documentation faster and more consistent
- **Documentation-First**: For complex features, write documentation first as design exercise

### 5. Work-Life Balance

**Current Challenges:**

- Frequently worked late nights when engaged in problem-solving
- Sometimes skipped breaks when making progress on challenging issues
- Difficulty "switching off" from technical problems in personal time

**Impact:**

- Occasional fatigue affecting next-day productivity
- Reduced overall efficiency despite more hours worked
- Missed some social activities due to work commitments

**Improvement Plan:**

- **Strict Work Hours**: Define and maintain consistent work hours
- **Mandatory Breaks**: Schedule and take regular breaks regardless of progress
- **Exercise Routine**: Incorporate physical activity for mental reset
- **Hobby Time**: Dedicate time to non-technical hobbies and interests
- **Social Connection**: Maintain regular social activities with friends and family
- **Mindfulness Practice**: Use meditation or other mindfulness techniques for mental balance
